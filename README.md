<h1>About Me</h1>Hi, I'm Mike Simon! <br/>I am an Identity and Access Management (IAM) professional focused on building secure, scalable, and auditable identity solutions for modern enterprises.

My background comes from hands-on IT support and security operations, which gives me a practical, real-world approach to IAM. I design identity systems with the assumption that **accounts will be attacked**, credentials will be leaked, and controls must limit blast radius rather than rely on trust. <br /> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikesimon123/">Connect with me on LinkedIn</a><br/> 
## How to Use This Portfolio

Each section of this repository represents a real IAM domain commonly owned by IAM Engineers and Architects in enterprise environments.

The content is structured to reflect:
- Architecture decisions
- Security trade-offs
- Operational considerations
- Risk-based thinking

This is not lab-only work. It is written as if supporting a production environment.

## IAM Philosophy

Identity is the control plane of security.

Strong IAM:
- Reduces breach impact
- Enforces least privilege by default
- Enables Zero Trust architectures
- Balances security with business productivity

Everything in this portfolio reflects that philosophy.
